# Thesis Summary

**Title:** Diagnosis Using the Chest Correlation Map Based on Tracheal Sound

This study investigates the use of correlation maps derived from multi-channel
tracheal respiratory sounds to distinguish between healthy individuals and asthma patients.

Key contributions include:
- Correlation-based feature extraction
- Analysis of multi-microphone spatial relationships
- Evaluation using Bayesian and SVM classifiers with LOOCV
